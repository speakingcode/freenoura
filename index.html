Noura Jackson is a 27 year old woman from Memphis, TN, who has been behind bars for over 9 years for a crime that she did not commit. She was arrested on September 29, 2005 for the murder of her mother, Jennifer Jackson.
      </p>
         
      <p>
She remained in Shelby County Jail East-Female Correctional Facility for close to three and a half years awaiting her trial. She was granted bond, but couldn't afford it, so she stayed in jail until February 9, 2009 when her trial started in Shelby County Criminal Justice Center in downtown Memphis, TN
      </p>
      <p>
Noura was convicted of the second degree murder of her mother after her two week trial which produced no physical evidence that Noura was anywhere near the crime scene. The bulk of the prosecution was a parade of Noura's friends who testified that Noura had done drugs with them and that, at 18 years old, she had a difficult relationship with her mother.
      </p>
      <p>
The police made their share of mistakes investigating the crime scene. They allowed a cat to wander around the house. There was a hair in her mother's hand that was never tested among other things. The crime scene gave evidence of an intense struggle between Jennifer and her killer that started in the bed and ended up on the floor. There were no bruises or cuts on Noura. Her acrylic nails and her manicure were in pristine condition in the police photos. And There was DNA evidence all over the crime scene that was not Noura's DNA, not Jennifer's DNA, but couldn't be matched with anyone else either.
      </p>

      <p>
In August of 2014 Noura was granted a new trial. At this point she has served 9 years and 4 months of her sentence. All of her family has abandoned her with the exception of her uncle's ex-wife. She now has a small group of supporters consisting of two mothers of friends and her aunt, her aunt's family and an old friend of her mother's
      </p>

      <p>
Now that Noura's conviction has been vacated and she awaits a new trial, she will have a bond hearing in February.  She, of course, has nothing and unless she gets help, we will not be able to post her bond.  We're asking you to help us raise money for her bond and to help with the cost of the second trial. Please, give what you can to help this innocent young woman.  Thank you very much.
      </p>
