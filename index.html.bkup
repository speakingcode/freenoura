Noura Grace Jackson was falsely accused and convicted of killing her mother based purely on circumstantial evidence. She has served 10 years in prison so far. The police found no blood or other DNA of  Nouras at the scene. However, there were two other unidentified persons' DNA found at the scene of her mother's death. She also had pristine nails in the pictures the police took of her hands. If someone stabbed someone over 50 times, they should have broken nails and cuts from the force it took to deliver that many wounds.

      It is highly unlikely that an 18 year old female would have the power to kill someone that brutally. Her mother, Jennifer, had an ex-boyfriend who she fault with regularly. The night before her body was found was her boyfriend's birthday, and he called her that day. Only they know what they talked about. She went on a date that night with another man and was dropped off at home late that night. He could of easily been waiting at her house and saw her being dropped off by another man and became enraged. His alibi was that he was at home alone asleep. His home was within a 1 hour drive of the Jackson house.

      The prosecution's withholding of evidence, and a comment from a prosecutor about Jackson's decision not to testify in her own defense at the trial, definitely may be the cause of her being found guilty. An intelligent jury would have seen that she was not guilty and come up with a Not Guilty verdict, based on the weak circumstantial evidence of the case.</p>

          align="right">

      <p>The defense rested after the state was done since the burden of proof falls on the prosecution, and the proof was simply not there. Those who viewed the trial and saw all of the evidence were blown away when a Guilty verdict came back from the jury.</p>
      <p>Anyone that has the time to research can see that the Shelby County DA's Office and prosecutor, now District Attorney, Amy Weirich, has a long history of violating people's constitutional rights in efforts to win a case at any cost. The justice system has been unjust to Noura Jackson. Please help us ensure that she doesn't spend another day behind bars for a crime she DID NOT COMMIT.
